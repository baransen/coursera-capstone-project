The city has quite a few similarities, too, with Toronto. They are both the financial and tourist capitals of their respective countries. Downtown Toronto and Manhattan are crowded with skyscrapers. They both have their signature landmarks that make Toronto and New York stand out. Quite obviously there is a constant movement of people between the two cities due to reasons like business, travel, profession, studies etc. The location within the city where the individuals stay would depend on the purpose of visit and duration of stay. Choice of the location, therefore, is an important part of the preparation for the visit."

As an example, considering the case of relocating from Toronto to New York, selection of the appropriate neighborhood would not only avoid wasteful expenditure for moving to a wrong neighborhood, but would also help in timely planning of other aspects of relocation - such as dialogue with the local school for admission, communicating for opening of bank account etc. In case the individual is relocating for higher education, he/ she would probably loook for an affordable neighborhood near the University. Thus, the problem statement of the project would be the following: -\n - Given the purpose of visit/stay, which is the right neighborhood in Toronto while moving in from New York and vice versa?\n"

People migrating from one city to the other for a similar or better quality of life\n    b. Professionals shifting to the other city looking to stay in a place with similar amenities\n    c. International students looking for a place to live with certain amenities within a budget\n    d. Businessman looking to open shop in the other city in a location which would offer good customer base and minimum competition\n\nAlthough this project concentrates only on movement between New York and Toronto, however, the solution model can be enhanced to create a planning tool for movement from one location to any other location in the world. The tool would aid in choosing appropriate neighborhood depending upon the purpose of move (viz, new business, better life, education, profession etc)."

Neighborhood details of Toronto and New York - Borough and Neighborhood names\n     b. Neighborhood location - Latitude, Longitude  \n     c. Details of venues in each neighborhood - Venues will include the following: -\n          i.   Public amenities (Departmental stores, Hospital, School, Bank, Post Office etc) \n          ii.  Recreational & sports facilities (Sports centre, Cinema, Museum, Gym, Yoga studio etc.)\n          iii. Shopping malls, airport terminal, railway station\n          iv.  Food joints (restaurant of various cuisines) \n          v.   Any other significant venues\n     \n     \nIn case of New York, both the data will be obtained from the database maintained at https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset (courtesy: \"Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in New York City\" Lab Exercise of week 3 of this Module)\n\nNeighborhood data for Toronto will be obtained from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M. However, the neighborhood dataset available at this website does not contain Latitude, Longitude data of the neighborhoods. The Latitude, Longitude data will be retieved from the site http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data.\n\nVenue details will be extracted by using **Foursquare location data**.\n\n2.2 **Data cleaning**.  Data downloaded or scraped from the abovementioned sources will be combined into one table for each city. Following data cleaning activities will be carried out: -\n\n    a. Borrough not assigned. In this case, the neighborhood record will be deleted.\n    b. Neighborhood not assigned. In such cases, the record will be deleted.\n    c. Wrong venue details. In some cases the venue type could be mentioned as \"neighborhood\". Such records will be deleted.\n    d. Pre-processing of Venues data. Following pre-processing will be performed with the venues data obtained by using Foursquare : - \n         i.   Generalisation of venue types. Venue details received through Four Square application would be categorised into broader groups indicating the nature of the venue, e.g., Food joints, public amenities, Recreational & sports facilities etc\n         ii.  Further attributes of the venue will be recorded as separate characteristic. E.g., in case of Food Joints, the cousine (such as Indian, Thai etc). These \n         will be used only if the individual has such specific requirements for stay / relocation. \n         iii. A parameter to indicate concetration (or density) of each venue category within each neighborhood will be included. \n\n     I will experiment with the above pre-processed data and try to figure out whether the clustering results improved due to the pre-processing.\n\n2.3 **Feature selection**.  Venue types will be used as the features of each neighborhood for further analysis. Selection of features will depend on the purpose of move. This is illustrated below: - "
